Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations the program gives a less accurate result

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

At least 1000 simulations can result in at least the top three tournament winners
