ðŸ“Œ **Harvard University's CS50x - Intro to Computer Science**  

## â–Œ Description
CS50x is Harvard's renowned introduction to **computer science and programming**. The course covers fundamental concepts such as **algorithms, data structures, memory management, and web development**, using **C, Python, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**.  

Through hands-on problem sets and projects, students develop strong problem-solving skills and computational thinking.

## â–Œ Objectives
â–¸ Learn **programming fundamentals** through C and Python  
â–¸ Understand **memory management** and **data structures** (arrays, linked lists, hash tables, trees)  
â–¸ Implement **sorting and searching algorithms**  
â–¸ Work with **SQL databases** and **web programming**  
â–¸ Develop a final project applying all acquired skills  

## â–Œ Completed Projects & Problem Sets
### â–  **Core Problem Sets**
